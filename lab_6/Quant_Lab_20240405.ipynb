    "The goal of this section is to gain a knowledge of, and the ability to use, simulation as a tool to understand biological systems. This exercise introduces you to simulation, asking you to simulate the Gibbs energy and probabilities for a two-state transition with different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional notes and helpful clues to moving forward. I told you in class that in order to simulate a two-state transition, you need two parameters ($\\Delta$H and $\\Delta$S), which are constant and therefore are the same at every temperature. **This is technically not true in most cases.** Both entropy and enthalpy are often temperature dependent, which is determined by the heat capacity difference ($\\Delta$Cp), obeying the following relationships:\n",

    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_1.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This just means that instead of writing the Gibbs energy at any temperature (i.e., $\\Delta$G(T)) in terms of two constant parameters (yellow), as we did in class and as reproduced here:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_3a.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 3a becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_3b.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\Delta$H(T) and $\\Delta$S(T) vary with temperature according to eqs. 1 and 2. This means that to get an expression for the Gibbs energy at any temperature (i.e. $\\Delta$G(T)) expressed in terms of constants, you just need to substitute eqs. 1 & 2 into eq. 3b and you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_3c.png\"/>\n",

    "which has four constants(yellow), the enthalpy and entropy at some reference temperature, T<sub>ref</sub> (i.e., $\\Delta$H(T<sub>ref</sub>), $\\Delta$S(T<sub>ref</sub>)), and $\\Delta$Cp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next important issue regards rewriting equation 3a in terms of the transition temperature (Tm) and the enthalpy at the Tm (i.e., $\\Delta$H(Tm)) instead of in terms of $\\Delta$H and $\\Delta$S. The reason is entirely parctical; it allows you to specify which temperature is the midpoint of the trasnistion between the two states (i.e., where $\\Delta$G = 0). We can get this by noting that at the transition temperature (i.e., T = Tm), equation 3a gives:\n",

    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_3d.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "That allows us to rewrite equation 3a as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.gordus.org/public_images/Hilser_Lab_6_3e.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, this is exactly equivalent to eq. 3a. Thus, to simulate a two-transition when $\\Delta$Cp = 0, you still need just two parameters, the enthalpy difference at Tm (i.e., $\\Delta$H(Tm)) and the transition temperature (Tm), both of which are constant (yellow).\n",
    "\n",

    "where you can see that there are just 3 constants (yellow), and that when there is no heat capacity difference (i.e., $\\Delta$Cp = 0), the second part of the equation (i.e. after the '+' sign) goes to 0, and equation 4b reduces to eq. 3e. Thus, eq. 4b is the general expression for the energy difference between two states in a two-state transition. It is the expression you will use in every simulation where the temperature dependence of a conformational transition is modeled.\n",
